# Overview  
 
Dashboards are customizable interfaces that visually organize key data into interactive components such as charts, tables, and gauges to help users quickly assess metrics and make decisions.    

This document provides an overview of Dashboards in Identity Observability and shows how you can create new dashboards.  
 
 
## User roles and access 

* Line Managers, Repository Owners, Resource Owners, and Auditors: Users assigned to these roles have view-only access to the dashboard. 
* Technical Administrators: Users with this role can create, view, and manage dashboards. 

## Usage  

Dashboards can be used for a variety of purposes. In Identity Observability, you can see existing dashboards of Controls and Observations. If you need additional components or alternative ways to present your data beyond what is provided by default, technical administrators can use the Manage Dashboards setting to create and customize dashboards to better align with business requirements.


## Steps for Dashboard creation  

Dashboards can only be created from the Dashboard Management Page. To create a new dashboard: 

1. Navigate to the Dashboard Management Page by clicking Admin > Manage Dashboards. 

2. Click on the Create button on the right navigation menu. 

3. Provide the required information: 

* Title: The name of the dashboard. 

* Category: The menu group in which the dashboard will appear. 

* Priority: The position of the dashboard within its category (higher values place it lower in the list). 

* Description (optional): A summary of the dashboardâ€™s purpose. 

Once created, use the View button to open and begin editing the dashboard content. 

 
## Dashboard List 

The main interface presents a table of all dashboards available in the current environment. The following information is displayed for each entry: 

* Title
* Author
* Menu: Indicates whether the dashboard is included in the portal navigation.
* Category
* Priority: Display order within the category.
* Status: Sharing status (Private or Shared).
* Recipients: Sharing target, if applicable.
* Description 

Dashboards can be sorted by clicking on any column header. Use the filter box above the list to narrow results by matching titles or descriptions (e.g., entering "stats" will display dashboards containing that term). 

## Selection Behavior 

The dashboard list supports both single and multiple selection: 

Click: Select a single item. 

Shift + Click / Shift + Arrow Keys: Extend the selection range. 

Ctrl + Click: Toggle selection status of individual items. 

 

## Available Actions 

All dashboard actions are available to administrators, based on the current selection: 

* Create: Launch the creation of a new dashboard. 

* Instantiate: Generate a new dashboard from a selected template. Enabled only if one template is selected. 

* Configure: Modify dashboard properties such as title, category, and sharing options. Does not allow content editing. Enabled only when exactly one dashboard is selected. 

* Assign: Reassign the selected dashboard(s) to another user. 

* View: Open the dashboard in view/edit mode. Enabled only when exactly one dashboard is selected. 

* Duplicate: Create a copy of the selected dashboard. Enabled only when exactly one dashboard is selected. 

* Delete: Permanently remove one or more selected dashboards. 

 

## Export and Import Dashboards

### Export

Click the Import button to load dashboards from a previously exported file.
