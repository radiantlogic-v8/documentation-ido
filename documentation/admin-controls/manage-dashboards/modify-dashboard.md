This document is intended for technical administrators who have access to create and modify dashboards. It outlines steps to update existing dashboards. 

## Available elements 

You can add or remove any of the following elements to your dashboard through the Manage Dashboards option:

You can personalize your dashboard by planning its layout, adding components, and adjusting their placement. Follow the steps below for an efficient customization process.

2. Plan Your Dashboard 

Before you start adding elements, consider your design strategy: 

* How many components will you need? 

* What types of components (tables, charts, gauges) best represent your data? 

* Which layout scheme (simple vs. complex) supports your goals? 

A thoughtful plan ensures that the layout and visuals work well together. 


3. Configure the Layout 

Dashboard elements are arranged on a responsive grid (fixed columns, flexible rows). Components must occupy entire grid cells.  

To define the layout: 

a. Click the configuration icon or select the Configure menu item from the dashboard menu to open the dashboard configuration wizard.  
 
b. Select the Layout tab. 

c. Click Layout and select a predefined scheme: 

  * Simple: 1â€“4 columns 

  * Complex: e.g., 3 columns + full-width row 

  * (Optional) Enable Re-apply template layout to auto-adjust component positions. 

d. Click Finish to apply the layout. 

> Note: New components will appear at the bottom of the dashboard in accordance with the layout. 
 

4. Add components 

a. Click on the pencil icon next to the dashboard name to view all available components. 

 These include: 

Visual Components: Tables, charts, gauges 

Layout Schemes: Grid-based column/row options 

Design Settings: Titles, descriptions, categories 

Display Options: Grid overlays, widget positioning 
 

b. Click on any of these icons in the Dashboard Design Toolbar to add components. A configuration wizard will guide you through each setup. 


5. Finalize component placement 

While in edit mode, fine-tune the position and size of each component: 

a. Drag & Drop: Move components by clicking the top section of component and dragging it to the desired position.  

b. Resize using the bottom-right corner. You will see the cursor turn into a diagonal arrow. Use this arrow to resize the component.  

c. A light grid overlay helps with alignment. You can uncheck Display Grid in the dashboard menu if you would like to hide it.  

 
Once your layout and components are finalized, save the changes and review your dashboard.
