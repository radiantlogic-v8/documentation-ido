# Overview  
 
Dashboards are customizable interfaces that visually organize key data into interactive components such as charts, tables, and gauges to help users quickly assess metrics and make decisions.    

This document provides an overview of Dashboards in Identity Observability and specifies which user roles have access to create, manage and or view dashboards.  
 
 
## User roles and access 

* Line Managers, Repository Owners, Resource Owners, and Auditors: Users assigned to these roles have view-only access to the dashboard. 
* Technical Administrators: Users with this role can create, view, and manage dashboards. 

## Usage  

Dashboards can be used for a variety of purposes. In Identity Observability, you can see existing dashboards of Controls and Observations. If you need additional components or alternative ways to present your data beyond what is provided by default, technical administrators can use the Manage Dashboards setting to create and customize dashboards to better align with business requirements.
