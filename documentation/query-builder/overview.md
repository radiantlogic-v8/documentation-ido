### Example usage  
Suppose you want to find identities that have been removed between August 1, 2025, and September 1, 2025.  
 
To get this data, make the following selections in the query builder: 

1. Choose Identities from the “Search for” dropdown.   

2. Choose “that have been removed” as the criterion. 

3. Choose “between” as the filter for date range “August 1, 2025” and “September 1, 2025”.  

 
The results will show matching identities along with details such as full name, employee number, email address, active identity status, start and end date, department, job title, repository, and priority.
