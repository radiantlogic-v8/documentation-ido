Using this interface, you can drill down into various organizational components.  
 
## Getting started

* Organization: See the whole organization’s structure. 

* Department: Filter and focus on specific departments. 

* Identity: Search for and review individual identities within the system. 

* Resource: Explore various resources available within the organization. 

### Filters and views  

Use the search bar to find a particular identity or resource. You can also view data in different layouts (Cloud layout, org layout or 3D view) by switching between the dsiplayed icons. Note that the 3D view is not recommended for large data sets. 

When you search for an identity or an resource, you can find different interactive components in the displayed result. 

Here is an example image that shows an identity's data displayed in cloud layout including the resources available to the identity.
